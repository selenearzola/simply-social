# Simply  Social

##Installation

Assuming that you already have installed  NodeJs, please clone the repository from [here] (https://github.com/selenearzola/simply-social.git)

Then, in the command line run:

    npm install

----
We use gulp command to compile the Project Assets.

    gulp

Once finished,  you should be able to see the project, or if you prefer I've created this extra [repository] (https://selenearzola.github.io/baires-challenge/) to show you the site created.
